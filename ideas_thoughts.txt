collection of thoughts:
 - also draw Rmin,Rmax,Rinit,v_thresh from normal distribution?
 - compare the results with only using linear regression of voltage
 - how is the copyright of using music data from e.g. spotify

Things to do / check:
 - Clarify that the mfcc in librosa package is performing the duty right. 
   To test: different audio files and see if they end up the same as the wav files.
 - Can alpha and beta be negative?
 - Possible: restructurize IOParser.java with a more clear structure.
